        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
        public: true       # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
                            # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
                            # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.
